# Citation Manager — Citation Management SaaS

Manage business citations across 958+ online directories. A modern, API-first alternative to Uberall, BrightLocal, and Yext.

## Status
**Phase 2A: 100% Complete ✅** — API Integrations (Google, Yelp, Facebook) shipped with rate limiting, retry logic, and full test suite. 958-directory registry loaded. Ready for Phase 2B manual testing.

**Latest:** Phase 2A shipped 2026-04-01 ([Issue #12](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/citation-manager/issues/12), [Issue #15](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/citation-manager/issues/15))

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/citation-manager/issues) and [Issue #17](https://github.com/michaelmonetized/citation-manager/issues/17) for status.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind v4
- **Authentication:** Convex Auth (passwordless signup/login)
- **Backend:** Convex (multi-tenant, real-time)
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel, Convex Cloud
- **Payments:** Stripe (TBD for Phase 2)
- **Analytics:** PostHog (TBD for Phase 2)

## Quick Start
```bash
# Setup
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL to .env.local
bun install

# Development
bun run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Sign up with your email
# Create location and test submissions
```

## Architecture
- **Multi-tenant:** Each client manages their own locations and submissions
- **Locations:** Store NAP (Name, Address, Phone) + website + hours + category
- **Submissions:** Track which directories each location was submitted to
- **Integrations:** API-based + form automation (Playwright for legacy sites)
- **Queue system:** Rate-limit submissions to respect directory API limits

- [ ] Customer support tools
- [ ] Production security audit

### Phase 4: Monetization (Ongoing)

- **Opportunity:** Replace $500-2000/month BrightLocal/Yext subscriptions with $99 alternative
- **Moat:** Proprietary integrations to directories with restricted API access

## Development

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy example env file
cp .env.example .env.local

# - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL: Get from npx convex dev
# - Convex auth is handled automatically via Convex Cloud
```

### Available Commands
```bash
# Development
bun run dev              # Start Next.js + Convex dev
npx convex dev          # Convex backend + type generation
npm run build           # Production build
npm run lint            # Run linter (oxlint)
npm run type-check      # TypeScript strict mode check

# Database
npx convex push         # Deploy Convex schema to cloud
npx convex pull         # Pull latest schema from cloud
convex/seed.ts          # See example seed mutations
```
