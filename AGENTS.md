This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running `npx convex ai-files install`.

## Fallow local gate

Before any `git commit` or `git push`, run `fallow audit --format json --quiet --explain`. If the verdict is `fail`, fix the reported findings before retrying. Treat JSON runtime errors like `{ "error": true, ... }` as non-blocking.

Audit defaults to `gate=new-only`: only findings introduced by the current changeset affect the verdict. Inherited findings on touched files are reported under `attribution` and annotated with `introduced: false`, but do not block the commit. Set `[audit] gate = "all"` in `fallow.toml` to gate every finding in changed files.
